        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
          <br>
      Marshall Bruce Mathers III (born October 17, 1972), better known by his stage name <b>Eminem (stylized as EMINƎM)</b> and 
      by his alter ego Slim Shady, is an American rapper, record producer, songwriter and actor. Eminem is one of the
      best-selling artists in music history, and easily one of rap's biggest crossover successes. To be certain, a great deal of the controversy Eminem courted -- during the turn of the millennium, there was no greater pop culture bogeyman than Marshall Mathers -- came through in how his violent fantasias, often directed at his mother or his wife, intertwined with flights of absurdity that appealed to listeners too young to absorb the psychodramas Eminem explored on his hit albums The Slim Shady LP and The Marshall Mathers LP.
          With hits "My Name Is" and "The Real Slim Shady," he ruled the airwaves, but it wasn`t long before some detractors acknowledged his depth, helped in part by singles like the mournful "Stan," written from the perspective of an obsessed fan.

              Eminem made his debut in the film industry with the musical drama film 8 Mile (2002), playing a 
              fictionalized version of himself, and his track "Lose Yourself" from its soundtrack won the Academy 
              Award for Best Original Song, 8 Mile was a critical and box office success. It opened at No. 1 in the
              US with $51.3 million grossed in its opening weekend and an eventual total of $242.9 million 
              worldwide. The album's accompanying soundtrack was also a commercial success, being certified 
              quadruple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The film garnered 
              numerous award nominations and wins, including an Academy Award for Best Original Song for "Lose 
              Yourself" win for Eminem, Luis Resto and Jeff Bass at the 75th Academy Awards. 8 Mile was named one 
              of the best films of 2002 by several publications. </p>

            <p>Bad Meets Evil is an American hip hop duo consisting of rappers Royce da 5`9″ (Bad) and Eminem (Evil).
              In 1999, the duo released a double non-album singles, “Nuttin` to Do” and “Scary Movies”; peaked at 36 on the Hot Rap Songs chart, while the latter peaked at 63 on the UK Singles Chart and was featured on the soundtrack of the 2000 horror comedy parody film Scary Movie.
              The duo broke up after a feud between Royce and the members of Eminem`s group D12.
              After Royce`s supergroup Slaughterhouse signing toShady Records, a reunion of Bad Meets Evil followed with the extended play Hell: The Sequel (2011), which reached number one on the US Billboard 200 and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and theAustralian Recording Industry Association (ARIA).
              The lead single “Fast Lane” peaked at number 32 on the Billboard Hot 100, while the second single “Lighters”, featuring Bruno Mars, peaked at number four on the same chart.</p>

            <p>D12, an initialism for The Dirty Dozen, is an American hip hop group from Detroit, Michigan. D12 has 
              had chart-topping albums in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. D12 was formed in 1996,
               and achieved mainstream success after Eminem rose to international fame. D12 released the album
                Devil’s Night in 2001 and D12 World in 2004, spawning numerous hits such as “Fight Music”, 
                “Purple Pills”, “My Band”, “How Come” and “Shit on You” throughout that period. Since 2006, Eminem’s
                hiatus and the death of the member Proof resulted in them being less active in subsequent years.</p>
