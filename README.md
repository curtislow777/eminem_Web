# Your Project's Name

My project is about an music artist called Eminem. I created this website as I am a fan of his music and would like to
share more about him and his music with other listeners. I feel inspired after learning about his story from how he
was an underclass and minority in rap and his struggles in life.

## Design Process

I designed this website after thinking about what are some of the things a new fan might want to learn about Eminem, especially since he has been around for over 20 years, there would be a variety of new and old fans.
This website is for fans and people who wish to learn more about Eminem.
This website showcases Eminem's discography as a solo artist, and also shows some of the other works he has been involved in with other artists.

This website is my website.
Provide us insights about your design process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

- As a new fan of Eminem, I want to learn about his albums released in order so i can listen to his entire discography in chronological order.

- As a fan of Eminem, I want to shop for merchandise related to him so I can show my support to him.

- As a fan of Eminem, I want to get updated on the latest news SO I CAN GET UPDATED ON THE LTATEST ENWS

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process.
These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory)
Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Social Icons:

- Scroll to the footer of the website
- Clicking any of the social media icons will direct the user to the social media page in a new tab

Index page:

- Scroll down to see merch
- Hover over images will dim it
- Clicking on images will redirect user to the product's official store page
- Clicking on the 'shop all button' will redirect user to the offical store page

Discography Page:

- Hover over the album images for it to expand

Contact form:

- go to "contact" page
- submitting an empty form will be prompted to fill out the fields
- submitting an invalid email address will prompt to enter a valid email address with an @
- submitting form without messagse will be prompted to fill out the field
- submitting form successfully will refresh the page

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
